# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is a variable meaning it can be called upon whereas an argument is a value that is passed within function.

  Researched answer: After research i found that a argument is a value that is passed through or within a function WHEN the function is called upon. A parameter is used and referred to DURING a function.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The .map() method takes in two or more parameters. I believe that the first parameter starts with the array that is being mapped because .map() only works on arrays and the second or more parameter is optional and can be a function or a value if required. 

  Researched answer: .map predefined parameters are the array that is being mapped and the function or value that is being mapped to the array. The first parameter is the array that is being mapped and the second parameter is the function or value that is being mapped to the array. The second parameter is optional and can be a function or a value if required.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Map is used to look through the whole array while filter is used to look through an array but return only certain parts hence "string"

  Researched answer: I think looking up the answer confused me more now but from my understanding the return that you get from .map() is with changes to the original array where the return that you get from .filter() is with no changes to the original array

4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is used to perform a task while a method is also used to perform a task but a method can only perform a task on an object I believe.

  Researched answer: Researching this answer was quite difficult because the answer I found online was that they are simply the same thing but a method is a function which is used in an object as a property.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: If i remember this correctly distructuring is taking a part of a function or array and giving it its own variable

  Researched answer: Destructuring is a way of extracting one or more values stores in objects or arrays. 



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I am going to make an assumption that hoisting is a way to somehow move a class or nest somewhere else in the code.

  Researched answer: Hoisting is a way to move a class or function or variable to the top of the code. This is done by the JavaScript engine.
